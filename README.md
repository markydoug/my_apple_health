# My Apple Health
A look into my health data

## Project Description
Over the past several years I have taken a journey to lose weight. I have lost over 30kg now and a lot of that is help to monitoring my food intake and exercise. I have stored all of this in my Apple Health app on my iPhoneÂ®. I have exported all the data and will go through to discover patterns and possibly predict future biometrics. 

## Project Goals
* Explore patterns in the data
* Identify specific patter

## Initial Thoughts
My initial hypothesis is that as my weight decreases my resting heart rate will decrease.

## Plan
- Clean the data
- Explore data for patterns
- Use patterns to predict future activity
