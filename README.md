# My Apple Health
A look into my health data

## Project Description
Over the past several years I have taken a journey to lose weight. I have lost over 30kg now and a lot of that is help to monitoring my food intake and exercise. I have stored all of this in my Apple Health app on my iPhone®. I have exported all the data and will go through to discover patterns and possibly predict future biometrics. 

## Project Goals
- Clean the data
- Explore data for patterns
- Use patterns to predict future activity

## Initial Thoughts
My initial hypothesis is that as my weight decreases biometrics will get better.

## Plan

## The Plan
* Export data from my iPhone as XML file

* Prepare data
    * Parse xml file and save into three dataframes ```records_list```(List of activities), ```workouts``` (Workouts from using Apple Watch®), ```close_your_rings```(Goal data from Apple Watch®.
    * 
    * 

* Explore data in search of drivers of churn
    * Answer the following initial question
        * 
        * 

* Develop a model to predict the value of a house
